Django practice

Hello!

Thank you for checking out my Repository!

This project is my introduction to Django, where I created a basic site on my own. It utilizes Django to

1. Make users for a database
2. Save any updates to those users
3. Delete any users

Admittedly, the HTML and CSS isn't impressive, as the main focus was just practicing with Django itself. I did add Javascript functionality to some of the buttons, which interact
with Django Template Language variables to call on certain urls and and views.
